## Will I get banned?

Tarkov Handbook is built with the same technologies as Discord (ElectronJS). ElectronJS runs using the Chromium engine which is just a specialized version of Chrome. Everytime you press the hotkey to show this application, it is the equivelant of pressing a hotkey, such as Alt+Tab, to show Discord. It's just minimizing it and maximizing it. It doesn't alter any game files or affect the game in anyway that would be considered a hack. 

Therefore, it is near impossible to banned for using this tool unless Battlestate Games used BattlEye to intentionally target this tool as bannable by reading your system's memory. And that is not happening any time soon.

## Installation

**Option One (Simpler):**
Click this link, to download the latest version. Once it is downloaded, extract the files to an easily accessible folder, such as a folder named TarkovHandbook on your Desktop. From there, open the `TarkovHandbook.exe` file and you are ready to go.

**Other things to note:** 
- Change your game to **Borderless** in the Graphics settings so that the application can easily overlay the game.
- The default hotkey to Show/Hide the application is `F3`. You can change this in the settings by clicking the cog icon in the top right of the application.
- While the application is running, you can manually Show and Quit the application by pressing the icon in your system tray (*Click the arrow in the bottom right of your taskbar to launch the system tray*).
